USE GITHUB ISSUES YA DINGUS



Stuff to do:

Major:

		- FullScreen Overlay:
		- Work out solution to allow app to overlay fullscreen aplications, DirectDraw applications already seemingly work without any extra work, however DirectX and OpenGL seem to require alot more work.

		- Overhaul directional pad buttons

DONE 03/03/14	- Implement key bindings in the options menu 
DONE 02/03/14	- Assign the correct onTouch events for L1,L2,R1,R2. This shouldn't take more than 15mins. 
Update: 07/03/14 - Add in the rest of the virtual keycodes (Just need testing)


Minor:
	- up key binding isnt defaulting properly to 'w'
	- Custom user button images / overlays.
DONE	- Fix the menu button, currently on touchscreen, it has to be held down to get it to stay open.
DONE	- Find a way to populate the combo boxes for the key mappings without having to do a list of 30+ for each Key, Ian you mentioned something about an array?
